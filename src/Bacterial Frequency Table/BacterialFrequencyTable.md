A scientist measures the lengths of bacteria in nanometres used in an experiment. 
The total number of bacteria measured for the experiment is unknown at the beginning of the data collection. 
However, their lengths are in the ranges of 1 – 800 (1 <= length < 800) nanometres.

The scientist wants to collect data based on the following ranges:
 < 200 nanometres
 200 – 399 nanometres
 400 – 599 nanometres
 600 – 799 nanometres

The scientist wants to produce a frequency distribution table from the data collected, which eventually will be used to construct a histogram.

Write a program that allows the scientist to enter the lengths of the bacteria until the number entered is greater than the upper limit of the specified range (1 <= length < 800). 
When this happens, the program should produce the histogram.

To achieve this we will be using the matplotlib library
